# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Project
Within this repository is the code I used to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game using Python.

Milestone 1:

Firstly, I needed to create classes to allow the camera to recognise the images I make when I show each sign.
Using the ‘Teachable Machine’ website, I created a model with four different classes – Rock, Paper, Scissors and Nothing.  
Following this I downloaded the model from the Tensor-Flow tab and the label file to observe what each class corresponded to.
